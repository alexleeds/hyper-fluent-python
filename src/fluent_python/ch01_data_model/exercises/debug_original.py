    üêõ DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS:
    
    This script has multiple breakpoint() calls. At each one:
    
    1. Use 'l' (list) to see current code
    2. Use 'p variable_name' to print variables
    3. Use 'pp variable_name' for pretty printing
    4. Use 'n' (next) to go to next line
    5. Use 's' (step) to step into function calls
    6. Use 'c' (continue) to go to next breakpoint
    7. Use 'q' (quit) to exit debugger
    
    Try these commands at each breakpoint:
    - p deck
    - p deck._cards[:5]
    - p first_card.rank, first_card.suit
    - pp vars()
