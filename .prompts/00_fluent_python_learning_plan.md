# Prompt Note: Fluent Python Learning Plan

Date: 2025-08-01

## User Proposal

> I’d like to create a program for learning the *Fluent Python* book by Luciano Ramalho in a manner that is as useful for practicing advanced programming as possible.
>
> This includes:
> 1. Reviewing the Fluent Python exercises with the typing methodology covered in *Robust Python* by Patrick Viafore.
> 2. Stepping through each of these programs and looking at the intermediary results with the Python debugger.
> 3. Using AI to create logical extensions of each exercise.
> 4. Using AI to rewrite the exercise in Rust and review the differences in structure and performance.

## Assistant Reflection & Suggestions

This is a solid, multi-dimensional learning plan. Here are some suggested enhancements to maximize its effectiveness:

### 1. Literate Project Structure

Use a literate programming repo format with systematic organization:

- `src/fluent_python/chXX_topic/original/`: Direct implementations from Fluent Python
- `src/fluent_python/chXX_topic/robust/`: Enhanced with Robust Python typing methodology  
- `src/fluent_python/chXX_topic/exercises/`: Interactive debugging scripts for deep exploration
- `src/fluent_python/chXX_topic/extensions/`: AI-generated creative extensions and edge cases
- `tests/`: Comprehensive test suite mirroring source structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter walkthroughs with rich annotations and visualizations
- `rust/`: Rust equivalents with performance benchmarking
- `docs/`: Generated documentation and performance summaries
- `.prompts/`: Learning methodology, prompt logs, and project evolution notes

### 2. Type-First Development

Adopt Patrick Viafore’s “design by contract” discipline:

- Write function signatures and protocols before implementation.
- Use `mypy` in strict mode.
- Optionally add runtime checking with `typeguard` or `pydantic`.

### 3. Systematic Debugging Methodology

- **Interactive Scripts**: Each concept gets dedicated debugging scripts in `exercises/`
- **Strategic Breakpoints**: Placed at key learning moments (entry, state changes, exits)
- **Progressive Exploration**: Start broad, drill down into implementation details
- **Comparative Analysis**: Debug original vs. robust side-by-side
- **Rich Introspection**: Use `rich.pretty`, `icecream.ic()`, and `pdb` advanced commands
- **Documentation**: Capture insights and "aha moments" for future reference

See `.prompts/debugging_guide.md` for comprehensive debugging methodology, commands, and workflows.

### 4. AI Integration Loops

Use AI in 4 roles:

- Extend edge cases: “What inputs might break this design?”
- Generate creative new examples
- Rust rewrites: “Port this to idiomatic Rust using iterators.”
- Performance explanation: “Why is the Rust version faster?”

Save these as versioned prompt logs.

### 5. Benchmarking & Performance Profiling

Use:

- `pytest-benchmark` for Python.
- `criterion.rs` for Rust.

Visualize with matplotlib or `critcmp` for side-by-side insights.

### 6. Continuous Integration

Set up CI via GitHub Actions to run:

- `ruff`, `black`, `isort`
- `mypy`
- `pytest`

Add pre-commit hooks to enforce style.
