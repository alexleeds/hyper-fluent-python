## Debugging Philosophy

This project employs systematic debugging as a learning tool to deeply understand Python's internals and the differences between original and robust implementations. Each debugging session should answer:

1. **How does this work?** - Understand the mechanism
2. **Why was it designed this way?** - Appreciate design decisions
3. **What are the trade-offs?** - Performance, complexity, maintainability
4. **How does the robust version improve it?** - Type safety, error handling
5. **What can break?** - Edge cases and error conditions

## Project Structure

### Directory Organization
```
src/fluent_python/chXX_topic/exercises/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug_original_{concept}.py    # Step through original implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug_robust_{concept}.py      # Explore enhanced version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ explore_{feature}.py           # Deep dive into specific features
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ compare_{aspect}.py            # Side-by-side analysis
```

### File Naming Conventions
- **debug_original_{concept}.py** - Interactive debugging for classic Fluent Python
- **debug_robust_{concept}.py** - Exploration of enhanced, typed versions
- **compare_{aspect}.py** - Side-by-side performance and behavior analysis
- **explore_{feature}.py** - Deep dives into specific language features

## Quick Start Guide

### Ready-to-Use Chapter 1 Scripts
```
src/fluent_python/ch01_data_model/exercises/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug_original.py        # 6 strategic breakpoints - Python data model fundamentals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug_robust.py          # 8 strategic breakpoints - Type safety and enums  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ compare_implementations.py # 6 analysis points - Performance and design comparison
```

### Running Debugging Scripts

#### Chapter 1: Data Model
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/hyper-fluent-python

# Method 1: Direct execution
python src/fluent_python/ch01_data_model/exercises/debug_original.py
python src/fluent_python/ch01_data_model/exercises/debug_robust.py  
python src/fluent_python/ch01_data_model/exercises/compare_implementations.py

# Method 2: Module execution (recommended)
python -m fluent_python.ch01_data_model.exercises.debug_original
python -m fluent_python.ch01_data_model.exercises.debug_robust
python -m fluent_python.ch01_data_model.exercises.compare_implementations
```

### Basic Debugging Workflow
1. **Start Broad**: Run the full script to see overall behavior
2. **Drill Down**: Focus on specific breakpoints for deep understanding  
3. **Compare**: Use compare_implementations.py for side-by-side analysis
4. **Experiment**: Modify values and see what happens
5. **Document**: Note insights and "aha moments"

## Debugging Commands Reference

### Essential Navigation Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `l` | List current code context |
| `ll` | List entire current function |
| `n` | Next line (step over) |
| `s` | Step into function calls |
| `c` | Continue to next breakpoint |
| `r` | Return from current function |
| `q` | Quit debugger |

### Inspection Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `p var` | Print variable value |
| `pp var` | Pretty print variable |
| `type(var)` | Check variable type |
| `vars()` | Show all local variables |
| `dir(obj)` | Show object attributes/methods |
| `help(obj)` | Show object documentation |

### Advanced Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `w` | Show current stack trace |
| `a` | Print function arguments |
| `u` | Up one stack frame |
| `d` | Down one stack frame |
| `source` | Show source code |

### Pro Tips for Effective Debugging
- Use `pp vars()` to see all local variables at once
- Try `dir(object)` to explore available methods
- Modify variables during debugging to test behavior
- Use `help(function)` to understand what methods do
- Step through both implementations for the same concept
- Pay attention to type differences and error messages

## Script Templates

### Standard Debugging Script Template
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Interactive debugging script for {concept} - {implementation_type} version.

Run this script and use the debugger to step through the {description}.
"""

import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add the project root to Python path for imports
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root / "src"))

from fluent_python.chXX_topic.{implementation}.{module} import (  # noqa: E402
    # Import relevant classes/functions
)

def debug_{concept}() -> None:
    """
    Step through the {concept} implementation with the debugger.
    
    This function demonstrates:
    - Key concept 1
    - Key concept 2
    - Key concept 3
    """
    print(f"=== Debugging {Concept} Implementation ===")
    
    # DEBUG POINT 1: Initial setup
    breakpoint()  # üîç Start here
    
    # Demonstration code with strategic breakpoints
    # ...
    
    # DEBUG POINT N: Final insights
    breakpoint()  # üîç Wrap up observations

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("""
    üêõ DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS:
    
    At each breakpoint, use these commands:
    - 'l' (list) to see current code
    - 'p variable_name' to print variables  
    - 'pp variable_name' for pretty printing
    - 'n' (next) to go to next line
    - 's' (step) to step into function calls
    - 'c' (continue) to go to next breakpoint
    - 'q' (quit) to exit debugger
    
    Key things to explore at each breakpoint:
    - Specific observations for this concept
    """)
    
    debug_{concept}()
```

### Strategic Breakpoint Placement
- **Entry points**: Function/method beginnings
- **Key operations**: Core algorithm steps  
- **State changes**: Object mutation points
- **Error boundaries**: Exception handling
- **Return points**: Method exits

## Learning Strategy

### Progressive Exploration Approach
1. **Start with high-level concepts**
2. **Drill down into implementation details**
3. **Compare original vs. robust approaches**
4. **Explore edge cases and error handling**

### Key Areas of Focus

#### Python Data Model
- How special methods enable built-in behavior
- Sequence protocol implementation

## Extension Ideas

### Creative Debugging Exercises
- Modify implementations to see what breaks
- Add logging to trace execution flow
- Create minimal reproductions of key concepts
- Build visual representations of data structures

### Performance Debugging
- Profile memory usage with `memory_profiler`
- Time critical operations with `timeit`
- Compare with Rust implementations
- Identify optimization opportunities

### Error Debugging
- Intentionally introduce bugs
- Practice debugging techniques
- Understand error propagation
- Test error handling robustness

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Import Errors
```bash
# If you get import errors, ensure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/hyper-fluent-python

# Check Python path
python -c "import sys; print('\n'.join(sys.path))"

# Run as module to avoid path issues
python -m fluent_python.ch01_data_model.exercises.debug_original
```

### Debugger Not Starting
- Ensure `breakpoint()` calls are uncommented
- Check that you're not in a non-interactive environment
- Try adding `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` if `breakpoint()` doesn't work

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install optional dependencies for enhanced output
pip install rich ipython

# For notebooks
pip install jupyterlab

# For performance profiling  
pip install memory-profiler
```

## Scaling to Future Chapters

This structure is designed to scale across all Fluent Python chapters:

### For Each New Chapter:
1. Create `chXX_topic/original/` directory
2. Create `chXX_topic/robust/` directory  
3. Create `chXX_topic/exercises/` directory
4. Use the debugging script template above
5. Follow the same naming conventions

### Template Ready:
The debugging script template in this guide can be copied and customized for each new concept.
